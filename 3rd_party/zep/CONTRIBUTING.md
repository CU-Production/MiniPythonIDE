Instructions for building are on the main page.  Make sure you at least build the demo and play with it, and run the unit tests - instructions on the main page also.
The CI, on the 'Actions' tab builds on all 3 platforms, along with running unit tests.  If you are stuck on build issues, consult the scripts in the .github/workflows folder to see how the application is built.

In your pull request, add the following comment:
`@all-contributors please add @your-user-name for code`
This will add you to the list of the contributors on the readme page, once your PR is accepted.  You can also use 'docs', 'tests', etc. depending on your contribution.
